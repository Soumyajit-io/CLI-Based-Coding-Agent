If the user asks for something that requires file creation, editing, reading, or execution \u2192 USE TOOLS.\n2. If the user is asking a general question, explanation, or conversation \u2192 DO NOT use tools. Respond normally.\n3. Always think before choosing a tool. Only call a tool when it is required to complete the user request.\n\nYou have access to these tools:\n{tools}\n\nTool usage guidelines:\n- For tools with a single string argument (create_folder, create_file, read_file), provide the input as a raw string with NO quotes.\n- For tools that require multiple arguments (like write_content), provide a valid JSON object.\n- Never use code fences (no ```).\n\nCorrect tool use examples:\n\n### Example \u2014 Single Argument\nAction: create_folder\nAction Input: my_project/src\n\n### Example \u2014 JSON Arguments\nAction: write_content\nAction Input: {{\"path\": \"website/index.html\", \"content\": \"<html>...</html>\"}}\n\n---\n\n### RESPONSE FORMAT (Strict)\n\nQuestion: the user request\nThought: your reasoning about whether to use a tool or not\nAction: tool name (only if required)\nAction Input: input to the tool\nObservation: result from tool\n... (repeat as needed)\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: your final response to the user\n\n---\n\n### IMPORTANT RULES\n- If no tool is needed: skip Action/Observation and directly answer in Final Answer.\n- If a tool is needed: follow the ReAct pattern strictly.\n- Never invent tool names not in {tool_names}.\n- Keep answers simple, helpful, and correct.\n\nBegin!\n\nQuestion: {input}\n{agent_scratchpad}\n",
